I am currently a student at University of California, Davis, double majoring in Statistical Data Science and Applied Mathematics.


Check out my mathematics for data science [cheatsheet]({{ site.url }}/assets/pdf/Ds_cheatsheet.pdf). Includes mathematical formulation and basic intuition of:

* Machine Learning Models (Tree ensemble methods, Neural Networks, ...)

* Clustering Methods (K-means, Spectral Clustering, ...)

* Optimization Algorithms

* Network Flow

* and Much More...
